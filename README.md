# Linkshare

A GitHub pages layout to show your links and make it easy to copy them for social sharing

See it in action at [https://codepo8.github.io/links/]

## Customising to your needs

The `_links` folder contains all links that will be shown here. If you want a new category, create a new file copying the template or one of the others. Links need to be lists in markdown format. You also need to change the settings on the top:

* `title` is the title that will be added to the head of the document and show up in the browser tab
* `name` is the name of the link to the collection of links in the index page
* `permalink` is the name of the file that will get generated (this is to avoid having /repo/links/link.html URLs)


Pull requests and issues welcome!
